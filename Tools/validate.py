"""Sanity-checks a mod's defs without launching RimWorld.

Catches the mistakes that are silent until runtime:
  * malformed XML
  * a recreation building that no JoyGiverDef lists, so pawns never use it
    (a joyKind on a ThingDef is only a label)
  * a texPath with no matching file, or a Graphic_Multi missing a rotation
  * a jobDef/thingDef/research reference this mod makes but never defines
  * an animation comp whose frame textures are missing
  * a def declaring a comp its parent also declares (def inheritance APPENDS
    list entries, so that silently gives the building two of them)
  * a [DefOf] field naming a def of this mod's that nothing defines - which
    throws on startup, before any of the mod loads
  * a vanilla def name that does not exist - research, joy kinds, stuff, items
    and so on - when pointed at a copy of the game's own defs:

        RIMWORLD_CORE_DEFS=".../RimWorld/Data/Core/Defs" python3 Tools/validate.py

    Without that variable this check is skipped, since the game's files cannot
    ship here. It is worth running before release: a research prerequisite that
    does not resolve takes the whole building down with it.
  * XML naming a C# class this mod's source does not define, or naming one at
    all when the assembly has not been built

Everything mod-specific comes from Tools/modtool.conf, so this file is the same
in every SloppyMod repository.

Usage: python3 Tools/validate.py
